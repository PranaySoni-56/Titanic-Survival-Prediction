# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, fare, and embarkation point. The prediction is made using a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning method known for its accuracy and robustness.
